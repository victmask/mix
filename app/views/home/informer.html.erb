        <h2>Test-Driving a NuGet package for MVC by <a href="http://remi.org/about">remi</a></h2>
        <p>When I�m working on my <a href="#" class="info"
                                     onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/mvc.html', event)">MVC</a>
            sites, I often find myself wanting features that don�t come out of the box.
            When I know I want a feature, my thought process tells me to:
            <ul>
               <li> Search on <a href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/google.html', event)">Google</a>
            /<a href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/msdn.html', event)">MSDN</a>/
            <a href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/stackoverflow.html',event)">StackOverflow</a>
            to see if the feature is built into MVC</li>
            <li>Search on nuget.org for a <a href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/nuget.html', event)">NuGet package</a>
            that has the feature</li>
            <li>Search on GitHub/Codeplex/Google Code for a project that has the feature</li>
            </ul>
            Can�t find it anywhere? I guess it�s time to make it!
            In this episode, we take a simple feature that I wish MVC had and implement it.
            Before we start coding, we actually look for a matching library! I found one that�s
            close to what I want but, unfortunately, the author didn�t make his source control
            available so we had no way of easily contributing changes :(
            After our tests are passing and the feature is implemented, we
            turn it into a NuGet package and publish it!
            NOTE We do this on <a href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('informer/linux.html',event)">Linux</a> using Mono.
            Clide is used to create our project.
            MooGet is used for NuGet support on Linux.
